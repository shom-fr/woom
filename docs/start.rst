The concept
===========

Woom helps you perform tasks in isolated environments, in a given order, optionally cycling through dates and ensemble members, on your laptop or on an HPC with a scheduler.

Here are some definitions.

A **task** consists of:

     * a job script generated by the workflow 
     * submission arguments, if any, for submission to a scheduler 
     * a list of dependent jobs whose successful execution conditions the start of the current job.

A **job script** is a bash file containing:

    * a line for :command:`trap` termination signals 
    * a block that declares the environment 
    * a line to change the directory 
    * a block of commands that do the main job 
    * a :command:`exit` command that outputs any trapped signal or 0.

    .. seealso:: :ref:`templates`

To set up your workflow:

#. Create a directory dedicated to your workflow.
#. Configure your tasks in the :file:`tasks.cfg` file, in particular their execution content and submission specifications.
#. Define the necessary environments, directories and scheduler specifications in the :file:`host.cfg` file.
#. Configure your workflow in the :file:`workflow.cfg` file, in particular the parameters for generating the job script, the cycle and ensemble specifications and the order in which tasks are submitted through the stages.
#. Add additional material such as the :file:`bin` and :file:`lib` directories, a :file:`ext` extension directory, or other useful files that you can access at runtime using the ``workflow_dir`` substitution parameter or the :envvar:`WOOM_WORKFLOW_DIR` environment variable.

A typical sructure of the workflow directory is the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    workflow/
    ├── workflow.cfg  # mandatory
    ├── tasks.cfg     # mandatory
    ├── hosts.cfg     # mandatory
    ├── ext/          # optional, woom extensions
    │   ├── jinja_filters.py
    │   └── validator_functions.py
    ├── bin/          # opttional, prepended to $PATH in the job script
    │   └── myscript.py
    └── lib/
        └── python   # opttional, prepended to $PYTHONPATH in the job script
            └── mylib.py

You can add more stuff to this directory and access it using the ``{{ workflow_dir }}`` template
in configuration files or the :envvar:`WOOM_WORKFLOW_DIR` environment variable.

Configurations
==============

Tasks with :file:`tasks.cfg`
----------------------------

Four tasks with arbitrary names are specified in the file.
The command lines use jinja patterns such as ``{{ data_dir }}``, which are filled with entries from both the ``[params]`` section of the :file:`workflow.cfg` file and the default entries provided by the workflow (:ref:`inputs_dict`).
Some of the tasks here use a ``prepost`` environment which must be declared in the :file:`hosts.cfg` configuration file.

.. literalinclude:: samples/tasks.cfg
    :language: ini
    :caption: Example of :file:`tasks.cfg`

See also the :mod:`configobj` :ref:`specifications <cfgspecs.tasks>` for this configuration.

Hosts with :file:`hosts.cfg`
----------------------------

This example file declares the resources available on the datarmor host, in particular its scheduler, the scratch dir taken from the :envvar:`SCRATCH` environment variable and the name of the ``seq`` queue.
An environment called ``prepost`` is declared using environment modules and environment variables.

.. literalinclude:: samples/hosts.cfg
    :language: ini
    :caption: Example of :file:`hosts.cfg`

See also the :mod:`configobj` :ref:`specifications <cfgspecs.host>` for this configuration.

The **default** :file:`hosts.cfg` declares the ``local`` host that matches any computer by default. When a user provides its own hosts file, this one is merged with the default file. The user must use the ``local`` to extened the configuration of the default host.
 
 .. literalinclude:: ../woom/hosts.cfg
     :language: ini
     :caption: Default :file:`hosts.cfg`
   
Workflow with :file:`workflow.cfg`
----------------------------------

In this example, we give our application a name, specify which data to loop over and declare the ``box`` and ``data_dir`` parameters, which can be used in the :file:`tasks.cfg` file.
The ``clean_data_dir`` task is executed only once and before the looping over dates because it is called in the ``[prolog]`` stage.
Other tasks are run sequentially for each date interval, except ``fetch_data`` and ``cp_config`` which are run in parallel since they are executed in parallel since they are called in the same sequence named ``fetch``.


.. literalinclude:: samples/workflow.cfg
    :language: ini
    :caption: Example of :file:`workflow.cfg`

See also the :mod:`configobj` :ref:`specifications <cfgspecs.workflow>` for this configuration.

Job script generation
=====================

The path to the job script is :file:`{{submission_dir}}/job.sh`.
The script is first exported as a string by :meth:`~woom.task.Task.export_content`, which contains Jinja patterns. See :ref:`start_jinja`. 
These patterns are then rendered by :func:`~woom.render.render` using a dictionary created by the :meth:`~woom.workflow.Workflow.get_task_inputs` workflow method.
See ":ref:`inputs_dict`" to see its default contents.
This dictionary is specific to a given task, at a given cycle, and for a given ensemble member.

Trapped exit signals
--------------------

Trapping the signal allows the job to return an exit status other than zero in the event of an error.
The exit status is stored in :file:`{{submission_dir}}}/job.status` and is interpreted by the workflow to know the status of the job.

Environment
-----------

The environment we need is specified by its name in the task configuration and is detailed in the host configuration.
It typically takes the form of environment module directives and environment variable declarations.

Run directory
-------------

It is specified in the task configuration and defaults to :file:`{{scratch_dir}}/{{task_path}}`.
You can use the ``scratch_dir`` and ``work_dir`` host configuration options, or any :ref:`other input parameter <inputs_dict>`.

Command lines
-------------

The bash lines are the core of what the task does.
They are configured in the task configuration and rendered as bash lines thanks to the powerful Jinja templating system (see: :ref:`start_jinja`).

Exit
----

Any exit signal that occurs is stored in :file:`{{submission_dir}}/job.status`.
This signal is then issued by the :command:`exit` command.

Finally
-------

The standard output is saved in :file:`{{submission_dir}}/job.out` and 
the standard error into :file:`{{submission_dir}}/job.err`.

Jinja rendering
===============

Jinja is a package that allows advanced template rendering.
See its `website <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/>`_ for detailed explanations.


Controling and running the workflow
===================================

Run all woom commands from the workflow directory.
See the :ref:`examples` section for more illustrative examples.

.. tip:: All woom commands support the ``--help`` option

.. highlight:: bash

First, make sure that the your workflow is well interpreted::

    $ woom show overview

Then, run your workflow in dry (fake) and debug mode::

    $ woom --logger-level debug run --dry-run

Then, run it in normal mode if everything is ok::

    $ woom run
    
To check the status of all jobs, especially on an HPC with a scheduler::

    $ woom show tatus

To kill jobs::

    $ woom kill      # all jobs
    $ woom kill 1264 # one job
    $ woom kill --task fetch_data # identified by task name
