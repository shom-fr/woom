Configuration specifications
============================

Configuration files are based on `configobj <https://configobj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configobj.html>`_ which allows values to be checked and converted, default values to be supplied and nested sections to be created.
To enable this, a specification file is provided for each type of configuration, as described in the following sections.

    cfgspecs.hosts
    cfgspecs.tasks
    cfgspecs.workflow
